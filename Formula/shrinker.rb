  # The zip is not MIT. Shrinker Pro's own code is, but the payload also
  # carries gifsicle (GPL-2.0) and pngquant with libimagequant
  # (GPL-3.0-or-later) as executables, plus BSD/libpng components. Declaring
  # only MIT would understate what a user is installing.

    # this states it outright instead. Homebrew links bin/shrinker from the
    # prefix into the Cellar, and depending on that symlink resolving the way
    # the tool expects is a guess; SHRINKER_HELPERS is not.
